## ‚ú® Dare to Discover, Dare to Achieve!

Dareora is an exhilarating web application designed to be a vibrant community where users can challenge themselves and others with exciting dares. This platform provides a space to connect, compete, and conquer, pushing limits and finding new adventures together.

This project is being developed by a dedicated team, leveraging the power of Django for a robust backend and modern web technologies for a dynamic frontend.

## üöÄ Features (Current & Planned)

* **Post Dares:** Users can create and share their unique dares, with options for public visibility or private sharing.
* **Explore Dares:** Discover a wide variety of trending and challenging dares posted by other users.
* **Leaderboard:** A competitive ranking system based on points earned from completing dares.
* **Community Engagement:** Interact with other users through comments, likes, and follows.
* **User Reviews:** Provide feedback and ratings on completed dares.
* **User Authentication:** Secure user registration, login, and profile management.
* **Responsive Design:** A seamless and optimized experience across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
* **Theme Toggle:** Switch between dark and light modes for personalized viewing, with preference saving.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Dareora is built with a powerful combination of frontend and backend technologies:

### Frontend
* **HTML5:** For structuring the web content.
* **CSS3:** For styling, animations, and ensuring a fully responsive user interface.
* **JavaScript:** For interactive elements, dynamic content, and client-side logic (e.g., image sliders, theme toggling).

### Backend
* **Django:** A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It handles:
    * User authentication and authorization.
    * Database interactions (ORM).
    * API endpoints for dare management, user profiles, and more.
* **Python:** The programming language powering the Django backend.
* **PostgreSQL (Recommended):** A powerful, open-source object-relational database system for robust data storage. (Can be configured for SQLite for local development ease).

## ‚ö° Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get your development environment set up and run the Dareora project locally.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Python 3.8+**
* **pip** (Python package installer)
* **Git**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yashika0128/Dareora.git](https://github.com/yashika0128/Dareora.git)
    ```
    

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Dareora
    ```

3.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    Install all required Python packages using `pip`.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing initial Django and other necessary packages.)*

5.  **Database Setup:**

    * **For local development (using SQLite, default Django):**
        No additional setup is usually required. Django will create a `db.sqlite3` file automatically.

    * **For production or more robust local development (using PostgreSQL):**
        * Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
        * Create a new database for Dareora (e.g., `dareora_db`).
        * Update your `Dareora/settings.py` file with your PostgreSQL database credentials.

6.  **Run Database Migrations:**
    Apply the initial database schema.

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

7.  **Create a Superuser (Optional but Recommended):**
    This allows you to access the Django admin panel.

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to create your superuser account.

8.  **Run the Development Server:**
    Start the Django development server.

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The application will typically be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## üí° Usage

* **Access the Application:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
* **Django Admin:** Access the administrative interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` using the superuser credentials you created.
* **Frontend Interaction:**
    * Use the navigation links to explore various sections.
    * Interact with the theme toggle (moon/sun icon) to switch between light and dark modes.
    * The homepage slider will automatically advance, or you can use the dots for manual navigation.

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions from all team members! Here's a basic workflow:

1.  **Fork and Clone:** Ensure you have cloned the main repository.
